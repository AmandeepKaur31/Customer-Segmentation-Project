#Estimate in statistics.
#The number of observations of a dataset or level of a categorical. 
#In R, run nrow(dataframe) or length(Vector) to calculate. 
#To calculate by group, run count(Data, GroupingVariable)

#Mean
#Mean The average of a dataset, defined as the sum of all observations divided by the number of observations. 
#In R, run mean(Vector) to calculate.

#Trimmed Mean 
#The mean of a dataset with a certain proportion of data not included. 
#The highest and lowest values are trimmed - for instance, the 10% trimmed mean will use the middle 80% of your data
